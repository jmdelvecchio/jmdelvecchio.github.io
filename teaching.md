# Teaching 

## EARS33
For Spring 2022, I wanted to modify the existing Surface Processes course to incorporate the skills necessary for students to succeed in the modern, data-driven geosciences. My course learning goals were:
1. List mechanisms of physical and chemical weathering; describe examples of weathering-induced landforms at small and large scales. 
2. Give examples of diffusive versus advective processes and how they affect hillslope morphology.
3. Explain why understanding channels and their behavior is fundamental to geomorphology.
4. Identify features, landforms, and deposits associated with different geomorphic processes (e.g., glacial, periglacial, aeolian, volcanic, tectonic, fluvial)
5. <b>Practice extracting key takeaways and outstanding knowledge gaps from scientific journal articles, and communicating those concepts in written and oral form to a nonspecialized audience
6. Practice acquiring, analyzing and plotting landscape data from computer models and databases </b>

(<i><b>Bold</b> objectives new to Spring 2022</i>)

Before the start of class, I asked my students to rank their agreement with the following statements (1 being strongly disagree, 5 being strongly agree), which aligned with one or more learning objective. At the end of the course, I asked the students to perform the same self-assessment. The class averages before and after the course are (ranked by largest change):
